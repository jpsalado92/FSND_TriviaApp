## Introduction
The following app is intended to work as a Trivia, so that players may test their knowledge in different areas. It is capable of:
1) Displaying questions - both all questions and by category. 
2) Adding and deleting questions.
3) Searching for questions based on a text query string.
4) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## A. Backend

The [/backend](./backend) directory contains a complete Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 


### A.1. Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

This project is intended to work with Python 3.7. Follow instructions to install python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

It is recommended working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the [/backend](./backend) directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM that will be used to handle the database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

### A.2. Database Setup
With Postgres, or any other RDBMS running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```
Alternatively in Windows PS:
```shell
createdb -U postgres trivia_test
psql -U postgres -d trivia -f .\trivia.psql
```

### A.3. Running the server

From within the [/backend](./backend) directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Alternatively in Windows PS:
```terminal
$env:FLASK_APP="flaskr"
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.

### A.5. Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb -U postgres trivia_test
createdb -U postgres trivia_test
psql -U postgres trivia_test < .\trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

## B. Frontend

The [/frontend](./frontend) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended to get the backend running first.
### B.1. Frontend Setup


#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```


### B.2  Running the Frontend in dev mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```
